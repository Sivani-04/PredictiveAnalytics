Introduction: In modern business environments, managing sales and inventory efficiently is crucial for profitability. This project aims to develop a predictive analytics model to optimize inventory levels and forecast sales trends, thereby reducing wastage and improving supply chain efficiency.

Problem Statement: Many businesses struggle with maintaining the right inventory levels, leading to overstocking or stockouts. Overstocking increases holding costs, while stockouts result in lost sales and dissatisfied customers. This project will implement predictive analytics to help businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory management.

Objectives: 
1.	Develop a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data.
2.	Optimize inventory levels by analyzing demand patterns.
3.	Reduce stock wastage and minimize stockout situations.
4.	Implement a user-friendly dashboard for businesses to visualize trends and make informed decisions.

Tools & Technologies Used: 
1.	Programming Language: Python (for data analysis, ML models, and API)

2.	Machine Learning Libraries: 
a.	NumPy (for data processing),
b.	TensorFlow (for model training),
c.	Statsmodels/Prophet (for forecasting)

3.	Web & API Development:
a.	Flask (to develop REST APIs)
b.	PostgreSQL (to store sales and inventory data)

4.	Data Visualization: Power BI (for dashboards)


API Overview:
Endpoint	                   Method	                 Purpose
/add-sales-data	                POST	               Store sales data
/get-sales-data	                GET	                   Retrieve sales records
/train-sales-model	            POST	               Train the forecasting model
/predict-sales	                POST	               Predict future sales
/optimize-inventory	            POST	               Suggest stock levels
/visualize-sales	            GET	                   Generate sales trend graph

Expected Outcomes:
1.	Accurate sales forecasting – Helps businesses plan ahead.
2.	Optimized inventory levels – Reduces stock wastage and shortages.
3.	Cost savings – Lowers storage costs and prevents lost sales.
4.	User-friendly dashboard – Provides real-time insights.

Conclusion: This project will help businesses make data-driven decisions for managing sales and inventory efficiently. By predicting demand and optimizing stock levels, businesses can save money, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction.
